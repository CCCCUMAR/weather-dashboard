# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## The Goal

The goal of this project was to create a page in which you could view the weather. on the page there should be an input area to search the city you want to cheack the weather for. for each city you search you should be able to see not only todays forecast but the forecast for the next five days. most of this ability made possible by the useage of the openweather api.
